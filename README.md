Hi there welcome to the my React responsive design app.

You will see a few examples of responsive design, a carousel and a stylish nav bar.

Just clone the app.

```
git clone git@github.com:abeaudoin2013/responsive-design-react-example.git
```

Install npm.

```
npm install
```

Run npm start.

```
npm start
```

That's it!
